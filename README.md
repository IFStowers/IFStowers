- 👋 Hi, I’m @IFStowers
- 👀 I’m interested in developing an active website to allow Rotary Club members to record attendance at weekly club meetings. The software will remind club members that they missed a weekly meeting and that they should try to attend next weeks meeting. For those who did attend, they will rceive a copy of notes taken at the meeting and a list of upcoming events.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, PHP 8, MariaDB, Python, and Django. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others who might already have developed similar software.
- 📫 You can reach me at @IFStowers or irving.stowers@mac.com
